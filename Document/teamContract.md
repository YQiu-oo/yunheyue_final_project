# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will meet every two day.Each meating should be last about 30 mins.Since we all live together, so we do not need other software to meet with other. Jianyi will record things in each meeting.
2. **Assistance** 
We create a small group on discord, if my teammates need help, they can just post the questions on discord or simplily email me or call me.
3. **Respect** 
In order to ensure everyone can share their thoughts, before every meetings, everyone has a chance to express their ideas and then we will have a small discussion of whether we can combine these idea with the project or add these ideas to make our projects more creative and specific or not.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will assign the work based one people's knowledge. We want to make sure each member will contribute same to the team.For the unexpected complications and unforessen work, we will meet together to solve it together. Some teammate with less knowledge, they will do more but simple work. 
5. **Time Commitment** 
We plan to work 1 hour each day, 7 hour a week. When there is a time conflict, we will finish our project work in advance or make up the work later.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
When there is a disagreement between our members, we will communicate and understand during the meeting. If there is a situation where one or more members do not complete the task or are late, we will give priority to communicating with the member and understanding the reason for not completing the task or being late. If communication does not solve the problem, then we will contact the course staff. We assume that situations will arise where the division of labor is not clear and the goals are not clear. We will expect each member to contribute to the project.
