# Overview

Airplanes are the most useful transportation for people traveling around the world. We want to make a useful tool that allows people to choose the shortest path between two countries so that people can save their time and enjoy their journey ^-^. The shortest path is one of the choices, if users want to choose their preferred paths, don't worry, our project allows users to choose different paths. Given the datasets, our code base will be able to guide its user in several aspects:

 1. Ideal Path(IP):The data structure we are using for this project is a graph. Given the source airport and destination airport, code base will return  the shortest path between two chosen airports,along with several stops. The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is a choice to find the ideal path. For the graph, the node is the airport, the edges the route, and the weight the distance between two locations(using latitude and longitude to calculate it).

 2. All Possible Routes(APR):Users can choose their preferred route. If the user inputs the source airport and destination airport, then it will display all possible paths with their distance. To achieve this, the code base returns all possible paths using the breadth first search.


# Tools and programming language
C++,etc.
